# WebSocket protocol

The Go gateway (`apps/gateway`) owns live delivery. Laravel still owns every authorization decision and every permanent write, so nothing in this protocol may create or mutate message history.

## Connection lifecycle

1. The browser requests a short lived credential from Laravel: `GET /api/v1/gateway/token`.
   The response contains `token`, `expires_at`, and the gateway origin (`url`).
2. The client opens `GET <gateway origin>/ws` (the origin is enough; the client appends `/ws`).
   Origins outside `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are rejected during the upgrade.
3. Within `GATEWAY_AUTH_TIMEOUT` the client sends `connection.authenticate`.
   Any other frame first closes the socket with `1008 authentication required`.
4. The gateway validates the token signature, expiry, and account status, then answers with `connection.ready`.
5. The gateway closes the socket with `1008 token expired` when the credential that authenticated it expires.
   The client renews by sending `connection.authenticate` again with a fresh token on the same socket.

`connection.ready` advertises the server limits so the client does not have to guess:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event_id": "…",
  "type": "connection.ready",
  "occurred_at": "2026-10-31T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "…",
    "instance_id": "gateway-1",
    "version": 1,
    "heartbeat_seconds": 30,
    "max_subscriptions": 250,
    "max_frame_bytes": 65536,
    "connection_token_expires_at": "2026-10-31T00:05:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Envelope

Every server frame uses one envelope shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event_id": "event-uuid",
  "type": "message.created",
  "conversation_id": "conversation-uuid",
  "seq": 105,
  "occurred_at": "2026-10-31T00:30:00Z",
  "data": {}
}
```

- `event_id` is stable and is the deduplication key on the client.
- `seq` orders messages inside one conversation and is present for message and receipt events.
- `conversation_id` is present for every conversation scoped event.

## Client to gateway

| Type | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `connection.authenticate` | `{ "token": "…" }` | Required before anything else; also used for renewal |
| `conversation.subscribe` | `{ "conversation_id": "…" }` | Authorized server side against membership |
| `conversation.unsubscribe` | `{ "conversation_id": "…" }` | Idempotent |
| `typing.start` | `{ "conversation_id": "…" }` | Requires an existing subscription |
| `typing.stop` | `{ "conversation_id": "…" }` | Requires an existing subscription |
| `receipt.delivered` | `{ "conversation_id": "…", "message_id": "…", "seq": 105 }` | Requires an existing subscription |
| `receipt.read` | `{ "conversation_id": "…", "message_id": "…", "seq": 105 }` | Requires an existing subscription |
| `ping` | `{ "id": "optional-request-id" }` | Answered with a `pong` envelope |

## Gateway to client

`connection.ready`, `connection.error`, `pong`, `message.created`, `message.updated`, `message.deleted`, `message.reaction.updated`, `receipt.updated`, `typing.updated`, `presence.updated`, `conversation.updated`, `sync.required`.

Errors are sent as an envelope with `type: "connection.error"` and a `data.code`:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `invalid_message` | The frame was not valid JSON |
| `invalid_payload` | A required field was missing or malformed |
| `unsupported_type` | The message type is not part of the protocol |
| `subscription_limit` | `max_subscriptions` was reached |
| `subscription_failed` | The membership lookup failed; retry later |
| `forbidden` | The user is not a member of the conversation |
| `not_subscribed` | Typing or receipt sent before subscribing |

## Validation rules

- Conversation IDs and receipt `message_id` values must be UUIDv4 strings.
- Receipts must carry `seq > 0`.
- Typing and receipt frames are rejected with `not_subscribed` unless the connection already subscribed.
- Broker events for `chat.events.conversation.*` and `chat.typing.*` must carry the same `conversation_id` in the envelope as in the NATS subject. Mismatched events are dropped and counted in `gateway_events_dropped_total{reason="conversation_mismatch"}` so one mis-published event can never fan out into another conversation.
- `typing.updated` payloads are additionally checked against the subject.

## Limits

| Limit | Setting | Behavior when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| Frame size | `GATEWAY_MAX_FRAME_BYTES` | Read limit closes the socket instead of buffering |
| Subscriptions per connection | `GATEWAY_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` | `connection.error` with `subscription_limit` |
| Global connections | `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | Upgrade rejected with `503` |
| Connections per user | `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER` | Close `1008 connection limit reached` |
| Inbound frames per second | `GATEWAY_INBOUND_RATE_PER_SECOND` / `GATEWAY_INBOUND_BURST` | Excess frames are dropped and counted; the token bucket refills continuously |
| Upgrades per IP | 4 per second, burst 10 | Upgrade rejected with `429` |
| Outbound queue | `GATEWAY_OUTBOUND_BUFFER` | Slow consumer closed with `1013` |

The per user cap is checked against the registry before the connection joins it, so one noisy client cannot starve every other user on the instance. Renewal frames refresh the expiry timer instead of creating a second registry entry.

## Close codes

| Code | Reason | Client behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `1000` / `1001` | Normal closure, gateway draining | Reconnect; backoff attempts reset on `1001` |
| `1008` | Policy violation: invalid credentials, expired token, connection limit, authentication required | Reconnect only after fetching a fresh token |
| `1009` | Message too big | Do not retry the same frame |
| `1012` / `1013` | Service restart, try again later (slow consumer) | Reconnect with backoff |
| `1006` | Transport failure | Reconnect with exponential backoff and jitter |

`isRetryableCloseCode` in `apps/web/resources/js/lib/realtime.ts` encodes this table. Close reasons are surfaced through the connection state so the UI can explain why realtime dropped.

## Client responsibilities

- Reconnect with exponential backoff plus jitter, then replay `conversation.subscribe` for every conversation still on screen.
- Re-authenticate on the same socket before `connection_token_expires_at`, and fall back to a full reconnect if renewal fails.
- Deduplicate by `event_id`, and reconcile live events against HTTP responses by `seq`.
- Never exceed `max_subscriptions`; when more conversations are needed, page them instead of subscribing to everything.

## Metrics

`gateway_inbound_throttled_total`, `gateway_token_renewals_total`, `gateway_slow_consumers_total`, `gateway_events_dropped_total{reason}`, `gateway_websocket_auth_failures_total{reason}`, `gateway_websocket_upgrade_rejections_total{reason}`, and `gateway_subscription_errors_total{reason}` make the failure modes above observable.
