## Architecture Principles

1. **Laravel owns business logic and permanent data.** Message creation, authorization, conversation membership, edits, deletions, and moderation are validated by Laravel.
2. **Go Gateway owns live WebSocket connections and event delivery.** It must not bypass Laravel's authorization and persistence rules.
3. **Go Worker handles asynchronous event processing.** Use it for outbox dispatching, fan-out, notifications, and other independent jobs.
4. **PostgreSQL is the source of truth.** Redis is for cache, presence, ephemeral state, and coordination—not permanent message history.
5. **Use durable event delivery.** Redis Pub/Sub alone is not a durable queue. Use a PostgreSQL transactional outbox plus one durable broker, such as RabbitMQ or NATS JetStream.
6. **Design for at-least-once delivery.** Make consumers idempotent and deduplicate events. Do not promise exactly-once network delivery.
7. **Use cursor pagination.** Avoid offset pagination for long message histories.
8. **Build incrementally.** Do not introduce Kubernetes or multiple overlapping realtime systems before there is a demonstrated need.

### Service Responsibilities

| Service | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Laravel | Authentication, authorization, profiles, contacts, conversations, message creation, message history, groups, moderation, API, Inertia pages |
| Go Gateway | WebSocket lifecycle, authentication, connection registry, subscriptions, live event delivery, acknowledgments, reconnect handling |
| Go Worker | Outbox processing, event publishing, notifications, fan-out, media jobs, cleanup jobs |
| PostgreSQL | Users, conversations, memberships, messages, receipts, notifications, outbox events |
| Redis | Presence leases, ephemeral typing indicators, cache, rate-limit counters, gateway routing |
| Durable broker | Retained/retriable event delivery between workers and gateways |
| S3-compatible storage | Images, videos, audio, voice messages, documents, thumbnails |

**Inertia.js note:** Inertia handles Laravel-driven page rendering and navigation. It does not replace WebSockets. Use HTTP/Inertia for pages and mutations, and a native WebSocket client for Go Gateway events.

# Database Schema

The following is the recommended logical schema. Exact column types, constraints, and migration details should be finalized during implementation.

## `users`

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`
- `username UNIQUE`
- `email UNIQUE`
- `password`
- `display_name`
- `avatar_key NULL`
- `bio NULL`
- `status_text NULL`
- `last_seen_at NULL`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `deleted_at NULL`

## `conversations`

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`
- `type` — `direct` or `group`
- `title NULL`
- `avatar_key NULL`
- `created_by FK users.id`
- `direct_pair_key NULL UNIQUE` — canonical sorted pair for direct chats
- `last_message_id NULL`
- `next_message_seq BIGINT`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

## `conversation_members`

- `conversation_id FK conversations.id`
- `user_id FK users.id`
- `role`
- `joined_at`
- `left_at NULL`
- `last_read_seq BIGINT DEFAULT 0`
- `muted_until NULL`
- `archived_at NULL`
- Composite primary key: `(conversation_id, user_id)`

## `messages`

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`
- `conversation_id FK conversations.id`
- `seq BIGINT`
- `sender_id FK users.id`
- `client_message_id UUID`
- `type`
- `body NULL`
- `reply_to_message_id NULL`
- `forwarded_from_message_id NULL`
- `edited_at NULL`
- `deleted_at NULL`
- `created_at`
- Unique: `(conversation_id, seq)`
- Unique: `(sender_id, client_message_id)`

## `message_attachments`

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`
- `message_id FK messages.id`
- `storage_key`
- `original_name`
- `mime_type`
- `size_bytes`
- `width NULL`
- `height NULL`
- `duration_ms NULL`
- `created_at`

## `message_receipts`

- `message_id FK messages.id`
- `user_id FK users.id`
- `delivered_at NULL`
- `read_at NULL`
- Composite primary key: `(message_id, user_id)`

Use this table only where per-message receipt state is required. For large groups, a per-member `last_read_seq` is more efficient.

## Additional Tables

- `contact_requests`
- `contacts`
- `user_blocks`
- `message_reactions`
- `message_edits`
- `message_pins`
- `user_devices`
- `notifications`
- `user_reports`
- `audit_logs`
- `outbox_events`

## Important Indexes

- `messages (conversation_id, seq DESC)`
- Unique `messages (conversation_id, seq)`
- Unique `messages (sender_id, client_message_id)`
- `conversation_members (user_id, left_at, conversation_id)`
- `message_receipts (user_id, read_at, message_id)`
- `contact_requests (receiver_id, status, created_at)`
- `outbox_events (published_at, created_at)`

Add foreign keys and suitable deletion rules. Consider partial indexes for active memberships and pending outbox events. Verify indexes with real query plans.

---

# API Design

Use `/api/v1` for versioned JSON endpoints. Inertia pages can reuse the same Laravel application services.

## Authentication

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/login` | Login |
| POST | `/register` | Register |
| POST | `/logout` | Logout |
| POST | `/forgot-password` | Request password reset |
| POST | `/reset-password` | Reset password |
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | Current user |
| GET | `/api/v1/devices` | List devices |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/devices/{id}` | Revoke device |

For a browser-first Inertia app, prefer Laravel session authentication with secure cookies and CSRF protection. If API tokens are needed for other clients, use a suitable token strategy separately.

## Conversations and Messages

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/conversations` | List inbox |
| POST | `/api/v1/conversations/direct` | Open/create direct chat |
| POST | `/api/v1/conversations/groups` | Create group |
| GET | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}` | Conversation details |
| GET | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages?before_seq=...` | Fetch older messages |
| POST | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages` | Send message |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/messages/{id}` | Edit message |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/messages/{id}` | Delete message |
| POST | `/api/v1/messages/{id}/reactions` | Add reaction |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/messages/{id}/reactions/{emoji}` | Remove reaction |
| POST | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/read` | Advance read cursor |
| POST | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/members` | Add member |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/members/{userId}` | Remove member |
| POST | `/api/v1/uploads/presign` | Request upload URL |
| GET | `/api/v1/search/messages?q=...` | Search authorized messages |

Every endpoint must enforce membership and resource authorization. Validate payload sizes, rate limits, and message types on the server.

---

# WebSocket Protocol

Use a versioned event envelope. Clients must not be allowed to choose arbitrary recipients or publish internal event types.

## Client → Gateway

- `connection.authenticate`
- `conversation.subscribe`
- `conversation.unsubscribe`
- `typing.start`
- `typing.stop`
- `receipt.delivered`
- `receipt.read`
- `ping` (if an application-level heartbeat is needed)

Message creation should use Laravel HTTPS in this architecture. The gateway can handle authorized ephemeral events such as typing, but should not bypass Laravel's validation and persistence with a separate message-writing path.

## Gateway → Client

- `connection.ready`
- `message.created`
- `message.updated`
- `message.deleted`
- `message.reaction.updated`
- `receipt.updated`
- `typing.updated`
- `presence.updated`
- `conversation.updated`
- `sync.required`

## Event Envelope Example

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event_id": "event-uuid",
  "type": "message.created",
  "conversation_id": "conversation-uuid",
  "seq": 105,
  "occurred_at": "2026-10-29T00:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "message_id": "message-uuid",
    "sender_id": "user-uuid",
    "body": "Hello!"
  }
}
```

- `event_id` is a stable identifier for deduplication.
- `seq` orders messages within one conversation.
- Edits to older messages must not be treated as newly created messages.
- Clients recover missing messages using the last confirmed sequence.
- Use exponential reconnect backoff with jitter.
- Reauthorize subscriptions after reconnect and membership changes.

---

# Recommended Packages

## Laravel / PHP

- `laravel/sanctum` — API tokens where needed; use sessions for browser auth.
- `spatie/laravel-permission` — optional roles and permissions.
- `laravel/horizon` — monitoring Redis-backed Laravel queues.
- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` — optional media lifecycle support.
- `pestphp/pest` — backend tests.
- `laravel/pint` — formatting.
- `laravel/pulse` — optional application performance visibility.

Do not install every package by default. Laravel Policies may be sufficient without a permission package.

## Vue / TypeScript

- Vue 3
- Inertia.js Vue 3 adapter
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-vue
- Pinia
- VueUse
- `@tanstack/vue-virtual`
- Zod
- `lucide-vue-next`
- Vitest
- Vue Test Utils
- Playwright

Optional: `@tiptap/vue-3` if rich-text editing is required.

## Go

- `github.com/coder/websocket` — WebSocket transport candidate.
- `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` — Redis client.
- `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` — PostgreSQL driver.
- One broker client for the selected durable broker.
- `log/slog` or `go.uber.org/zap` — structured logging.
- `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` — Prometheus metrics.
- `golang.org/x/time/rate` — rate-limiting primitives.
- `go test`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint` — quality checks.

---

# Security Requirements

## Authentication and Authorization

- Enforce session/credential expiration and revocation.
- Check membership and permissions for every private conversation operation.
- Reauthorize subscriptions after membership is revoked.
- Never trust client-provided sender IDs or recipient lists.
- Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies for browser sessions.
- Use scoped, short-lived gateway credentials or secure session introspection.
- Never put long-lived credentials in WebSocket URLs.

## Transport and WebSockets

- HTTPS/WSS only in production.
- Explicit WebSocket origin allowlist.
- Connection limits and message-size limits.
- Read/write deadlines and bounded buffers.
- Rate limits for login, messaging, contact requests, and uploads.
- Do not log credentials or private message contents.

## Input and File Safety

- Sanitize rich text and prevent stored XSS.
- Validate MIME type, file signature, and size.
- Generate random storage keys.
- Scan uploaded files where appropriate.
- Enforce download authorization.
- Use safe content-disposition headers.
- Restrict supported file types according to product requirements.

## Data Protection

- Encrypt traffic and protect backups at rest where appropriate.
- Keep database, Redis, and broker on private networks.
- Use least-privilege credentials per service.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Audit administrative and moderation actions.
- Define retention, export, account deletion, and backup restoration policies.

## End-to-End Encryption

E2EE is a separate design effort. It requires client-side encryption, key exchange, multi-device key management, recovery planning, and encrypted attachment handling. TLS alone is not E2EE. Server-side search, moderation, notifications, and message previews may need redesign if E2EE is implemented.

---

# Deployment Architecture

Use Docker Compose or an equivalent deployment platform initially. Kubernetes is not required merely because the system contains multiple services.

## Services

- Laravel web application.
- Laravel queue workers for Laravel-owned jobs.
- Go WebSocket Gateway.
- Go Worker.
- PostgreSQL.
- Redis.
- One durable event broker.

- [ ] Configure health checks and restart policies.
- [ ] Run migrations as a controlled deployment step.
- [ ] Configure Nginx WebSocket timeouts and upgrade headers.
- [ ] Configure graceful shutdown and connection draining.
- [ ] Configure backups and periodically test restores.
- [ ] Use separate least-privilege credentials for each service.
- [ ] Store media outside application container filesystems.
- [ ] Add deployment rollback procedures.
- [ ] Document operational runbooks.

## Monitoring Metrics

- Active WebSocket connections.
- Connection failures and reconnect rate.
- Message creation latency.
- Message delivery latency.
- Outbox backlog and oldest event age.
- Queue retry and failure count.

# Final Recommended Defaults

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Application architecture | Laravel modular monolith |
| Frontend | Vue 3 + TypeScript + Inertia + Tailwind |
| UI components | shadcn-vue |
| Client state | Pinia |
| Primary database | PostgreSQL |
| Browser authentication | Laravel session + secure cookies |

| Durable event flow | PostgreSQL transactional outbox + one durable broker |
| Ephemeral state | Redis |
| Media | S3-compatible object storage |
| Deployment | Docker Compose + Nginx |
| Testing | Pest + Vitest + Playwright + Go tests |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana + structured logs |

**Primary engineering priority:** make message persistence, idempotency, durable event processing, and reconnect recovery reliable before optimizing for connection count. Registered users are not the same as concurrent connections; capacity planning must use measured concurrency, message rate, group sizes, payload sizes, and latency targets.
